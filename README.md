# JACK-The-RobotDog[wip]
A Quadrupedal Robot: "Robo-Dog"

Overview:
The Robo-Dog project aims to develop a quadrupedal robot capable of dynamic movement and agility by implementing Inverse Kinematics (IK) control using servo motors. Each foot of the robot has 6 degrees of freedom(DOF) to ensure versatile and lifelike motion. Initially programmed with Arduino, the project seeks to leverage the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) capabilities for simulation, calibration, and enhanced control algorithms.

Essential Components and Features:
1. The Robo-Dog is designed with a quadrupedal configuration for stability and adaptability across various terrains and environments.

2. Inverse Kinematics algorithms are employed to calculate the joint angles required to position the robot's feet accurately. This enables precise control over the movement of each leg, facilitating fluid motion and dynamic responses.

3. Servo Motors: High-torque servo motors are utilized at each joint to actuate the degrees of freedom in the legs. These motors provide the necessary power and precision to execute complex movements efficiently.

4. ROS2 Integration: The project aims to transition from Arduino IDE to ROS2 for enhanced control, simulation, and calibration capabilities. ROS2 provides a robust framework for developing complex robotic systems, offering features such as real-time communication, modular architecture, and extensive libraries for sensor integration and algorithm development.

5. Simulation Environment: ROS2 enables the creation of a simulated environment where the Robo-Dog's behavior can be tested and refined before deployment in real-world scenarios. Simulation allows for rapid prototyping, optimization of control algorithms, and system performance evaluation under various conditions.

Potential Applications:
1. Research and Education: The Robo-Dog project is a platform for exploring concepts in robotics, kinematics, and control algorithms. It can be utilized in educational settings to teach students about robotic design, programming, and motion planning.

2. Search and Rescue: The agility and mobility of the Robo-Dog render it suitable for applications in search and rescue missions, where it can navigate challenging terrain and access hard-to-reach areas to locate and assist survivors.

In conclusion, the Robo-Dog project combines Inverse Kinematics control with servo motors, Arduino programming, and ROS2 integration to develop a versatile quadrupedal robot capable of dynamic movement and agility. By leveraging ROS2 for simulation and calibration, the project aims to enhance the robot's capabilities and facilitate its deployment in various real-world applications.
